"""Advanced Parallel Pressure Control example

This example shows how to send concurrent pressure orders using threads.
The Dll handles parallel calls, functions can be called simultaneously.
This demonstrates thread handling, same result is obtained using 
successive calls as all function calls are executed instantly (within a few Âµs)

Hardware setup: At least two Fluigent pressure controllers (MFCS, MFCS-EZ or Flow EZ)
